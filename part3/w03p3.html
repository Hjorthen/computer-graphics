For the cube in part 1, two rotations were used. The first rotation rotated the cube 45 degrees around the Y-axis, causing it to be in dimetric view. It was then rotated around the X-axis to bring it into isometric view. No projection matrix was needed since the cube coordinates already were in   view volume coordinates.<br>
    The transformation can be thought as:<br>
    MV = Rx * Ry
    <br>
    where Rx is the rotation around X and Ry is the rotation around y.

    <br>
    For part 2, the same rotation matrices were used in addition to a translation matrix to place the perspectives adjecent to each other.  However, this time a projection matrix is also used to bring the final coordinates into the view volume. <br>
        MVP = T * Rx * Ry<br>
        The translation matrix is applied after the rotation since rotation is applied around the origin. For each of the cubes the transformation is (-3, 0, 3) along the x-axis.
