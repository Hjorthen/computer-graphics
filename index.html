    This website shows the progression through a course I took in computer graphics at university. It was quite time consuming so the code is quite rough in many places, as I initially was unsure about both Javascript and WebGL. Some of the later projects are better and make use of some tricks that I picked up along the way.

    Each step for the exercises has been embedded in an iFrame to give an overview of what they involve. Each pane includes a link to both the code for rendering but also the html which often includes the custom shader code. 
    This will serve as a reference on how you can progress with WebGL by starting simple and then progress to more advanced topics.

    At the end you will find a procedurally generated terrain along with the whitepaper on how it was made.
